file that begin with:
H - helper files with functions and classes and stuff to be imported
L - level files which are playable levels
S - screen files which are UIs

use main.py to run any of the L or S files or else it'll do nothing


chatgpt prompt:
I've been working on a project in Python, and came across a coding problem that stumped me. I have to delete instances of a class from a list, based on a variable within said instance. For example, the list might be: [Object1, Object2, Object3]. I have to iterate through the list and delete the objects which have the variable deleted set to True. I can't just simply iterate through the list because deleting objects in the list you're iterating from will cause it to skip items.
Can you help me find a solution to this?

ok wtf chatgpt just instantly solved the problem??

I've been working on a project in Python, and wanted to create a class in which two class attributes are able to update each other. For example, if I have class attributes called 'x1', 'x2', and 'width', I want to be able to change 'x1' and have it update 'width', while also being able to change 'width', and have it update 'x2'.
Here is some example code:
```
from typing import Any

class Coordinates:

    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2) -> None:
        self.x1 = x1
        self.y1 = y1
        self.x2 = x2
        self.y2 = y2

        self.width = x2 - x1
        self.height = y2 - y1
    
    def __setattr__(self, name: str, value: Any):
        super().__setattr__(name, value)

        if name == 'x1':
            self.width = self.x2 - self.x1

        if name == 'width':
            self.x2 = self.x1 + self.width
    

coordinates = Coordinates(1, 1, 10, 10)
print(coordinates.width) # should return 9

coordinates.x1 = 4
print(coordinates.width) # should return 6

coordinates.width = 100
print(coordinates.x2) # should return 101
```
Can you help me find a solution to this?

ok so in conclusion doing this is way too complex and i should just find a work-around lmao

How would I avoid infinite recursion in this situation?
```
@x.setter
def x(self, num: float | int):
    self.x = num # causes infinite recusion because it calls this function while trying to set x
    ... # additional code here
```
